Erlbot
======

A project to teach me erlang, coincidentially also an IRC bot!

Supported bot commands:
	
	Join Channel: 
		-channel join #channel
		
		Joins a channel.
	
	Part Channel: 
		-channel part #channel
		
		Parts a channel.
	
	List Channels: 
		-channel list
		
		Returns a list of running channel processes.
	
	Register Plugin:
		-plugin register #channel <gen_server callback module>
		
		Spawns a gen_server callback module and registers it with
		the channel process.

Vaguely How it Works
====================

A 'server' process is spawned, this is responsible for handling the socket to the server. Currently it also handles logging in to the IRC server by spawning a login process. This just waits a few seconds then sends the USER/NICK commands. The 'server' reads data from the socket, splits it into lines, then sends those lines individually to the 'bot' process.

On receiving a line, the bot spawns a process to parse it. If the line can't be parsed then the parse process crashes. If the line is successfully parsed then a message is sent back to the bot process containing the parsed packet as an erlang term.

Upon receiving an IRC packet containing a PRIVMSG sent directly from the bot owner to the bot, a bot:handle_command/2 process is spawned and given the packet. If the packet doesn't contain a bot command, then the handle_bot_command process will crash and no action will be taken.

A bot command to join a channel will spawn a new 'channel' process and send a cast to it telling it to join. A channel process will stay alive after you part the channel, letting you keep any registered plugins.

When the bot receives a PRIVMSG sent to a channel then that packet will be relayed to the process handling that channel.

At the moment, all the channel process do is relay the IRC event to the plugins, but the IRC packet isn't sent, instead a simpler, more concise term structure is used.

There is a seperate process per plugin, per channel. Currently they're only spawned through the IRC -plugin register <#channel> <module> command.

Plugins
=======

Plugins are gen_server processes that accept a cast of: 

{ ChannelPid, privmsg, FromNick, Message }

Messages can be sent to a channel using: 

channel:say( ChannelPid, "message" ).
